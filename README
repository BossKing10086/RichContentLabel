Solarized
=========

## Precision colors for machines and people

[![solarized dualmode](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/raw/master/img/solarized-yinyang.png)](#features)\


Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) 
designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several [unique 
properties](#features). I designed this colorscheme with both precise 
[CIELAB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space) lightness relationships 
and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been 
tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as 
uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting 
conditions.

***See the [changelog] for what's new in the most recent release.***

Rich Content Label

It's a small browser render engine for browser, using Core-Text without leverage the UIWebView.
